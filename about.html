    </h2>

    <p>
        To get the most out of using Mualani, you will have to<br>
        level her skills up by using Talent materials, which<br>
        vary from character-to-character.

    <p>You'll need to farm a lot of Whistle and Contention<br>
        materials to fully upgrade Mualani's capabilities.
