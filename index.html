    <h2>
        Surfshark Wavebreaker
    </h2>

    <p>
        Combining her mastery of speed and the waves and water, Mualani can surf anytime,<br> anywhere.
        After using this skill, Mualani will gain 60 Nightsoul points and enter the Nightsoul's <br>
        Blessing state.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nightsoul's Blessing: Mualani
        Continuously consume Nightsoul points. When they are depleted or when the skill is used again, Mualani's Nightsoul's Blessing will end. The state itself has the following traits:
        ·Mualani mounts her Sharky Surfboard, increasing Mualani's Movement SPD and interruption resistance. Mualani can move on water and liquid Phlogiston while this state is active, and she will take no DMG from the latter.
        ·Normal Attacks will be converted to Sharky's Bites, dealing Nightsoul-aligned Hydro DMG based on Mualani's Max HP. Sharky's Bites can be used in mid-air. DMG dealt this way is considered Normal Attack DMG.
        ·When she makes contact with opponents in this state, Mualani applies "Marked as Prey" to them and gains 1 Wave Momentum stack. Max 3 stacks. 1 stack can be gained from the same opponent every 0.7s.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wave Momentum and Marked as Prey
        When Mualani uses Sharky's Bite, her DMG dealt increases based on Wave Momentum stacks. When she has 3 stacks, Sharky's Bite will be converted to Sharky's Surging Bite, further increasing her DMG and removing all her stacks when hitting an opponent.           
    </p>

    <p>
        When Sharky's Bite hits an opponent Marked as Prey, that mark will be removed, and she will fire Shark Missiles at up to 5 nearby opponents Marked as Prey, dealing DMG to them equal to this Sharky's Bite instance and clearing their Marks. If more than 1 opponent is the target of Sharky's Bite and Shark Missiles, the DMG dealt will decrease, decreasing at most to 72% of the original DMG when 3 opponents are targeted.
    </p>

    <p>
        First off, Sharky is a freshwater shark oImages/kachina.webpn top of being a surfboard. Second, it's not that it wants to eat for real, just that it definitely bites for real.

    </h2>

    <p>
        Fires a Super Shark Missile that can track opponents, dealing Nightsoul-aligned AoE Hydro DMG based on Mualani's Max HP.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mualani picked this moniker for launching her Shark Missile because it combines the warmth of explosive passion with a more chill, laid-back vibe — most hot spring-ish.

    <h2>
        Normal attack
    </h2>

    <p>
        Performs up to 5 rapid strikes.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Charged Attack
    </h2>

    <p>
        Consumes a certain amount of Stamina to unleash 2 rapid sword strikes.
    </p>

    <h2>Plunging Attack</h2>

    <p>
        Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact. If this Plunging Attack is triggered by Chihayaburu, it will be converted to Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan.
    </p>

    <h2>Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan</h2>

    <p>
        When a Plunging Attack is performed using the effects of the Elemental Skill Chihayaburu, Plunging Attack DMG is converted to Anemo DMG and will create a small wind tunnel via a secret blade technique that pulls in nearby objects and opponents.       
    </p>

    <img src="Images/kazuha's skills.png" alt="kazuha'skills logo">

    <p>
        Unleashes a secret technique as fierce as the rushing wind that pulls objects and opponents towards Kazuha's current position before launching opponents within the AoE, dealing Anemo DMG and lifting Kazuha into the air on a rushing gust of wind.
        Within 10s of remaining airborne after casting Chihayaburu, Kazuha can unleash a powerful Plunging Attack known as Midare Ranzan.
    </p>

    <h2>(Press/Tap)</h2>

    <p>
        Can be used in mid-air.
    </p>

    <h2>Hold</h2>

    <p>
        Charges up before unleashing greater Anemo DMG over a larger AoE than (Press/Tap) Mode.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan
    </h2>

    <p>
        When a Plunging Attack is performed using the effects of the Elemental Skill Chihayaburu, Plunging Attack DMG is converted to Anemo DMG. On landing, Kazuha creates a small wind tunnel via a secret blade technique that pulls in nearby objects and opponents.
        Midare Ranzan's DMG is considered Plunging Attack DMG.
    </p>

    <img src="Images/kazuha's ulti.png" alt="kazuha's ulti logo">

    <p>
        The signature technique of Kazuha's self-styled bladework — a single slash that strikes with the force of the first winds of autumn, dealing AoE Anemo DMG.
        The blade's passage will leave behind a field named "Autumn Whirlwind" that periodically deals AoE Anemo DMG to opponents within its range.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Elemental Absorption
    </h2>

    <p>
        If Autumn Whirlwind comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.
        Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.
    </p>

    <img src="Images/kazuha's soumon.png" alt="kazuha's soumon logo">

    <p>
        If Chihayaburu comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro when cast, Chihayaburu will absorb that element and if Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan is used before the effect expires, it will deal an additional 200% ATK of the absorbed elemental type as DMG. This will be considered Plunging Attack DMG.<br>
        Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use of Chihayaburu.
    </p>

    <img src="Images/kazuha's poetics.png" alt="kazuha's poetics logo">

    <p>
        Upon triggering a Swirl reaction, Kaedehara Kazuha will grant all party members a 0.04% Elemental DMG Bonus to the element absorbed by Swirl for every point of Elemental Mastery he has for 8s. Bonuses for different elements obtained through this method can co-exist.

        Decreases sprinting Stamina consumption for your own party members by 20%.
